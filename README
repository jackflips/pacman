Things that need to be implemented for ghost AI:

Condition: GhostBetweenGhostAndPacman
Follows the shortest available path from the ghost's location to pacman's location
Returns true iff there is another ghost on this path.

Actions:
RunAndScatterAction
Flees Pacman and tries to avoid other ghosts as well.

GetToEmptyFlankAction
Attempts to get to one of Pacman's anticept destinations that is far away from other ghosts
not really sure how to implement
the most important part is avoiding other ghosts though

GhostAnticeptAction
Attempts to move towards one of Pacman's anticept destinations while moving closer to Pacman
not entirely sure how to implement this either
but have a vague idea
